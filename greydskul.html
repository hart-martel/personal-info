    The time flies really fast and I am already at my grade school. There's an experience i can never ever forget, 
    it is when i am still at Grade 3. I was a cute little boy that time and ofcourse i am a clever smart kid. I am 
    admired that time by my classmates.   And also not to mention, in that same year, i got my first Puppy Love. She 
    confessed to me that time that she likes me, and i was like "Oooh okay", it was really awkward that time though. 
    But still i answered yes (weird right?). But i don't really expect that much to it back then because i knew to my 
    self that it wasn't true love, afterall we were just children, but atleast i enjoyed it :)
