    Years has passed till i can finally crawl using my feet and hands, i became more active and curious all about the 
    things around me. i became "makulit na bata" who plays every time. I also spent my toddler years in the province 
    together with my Lolo's and Lola's. One time, when i was crawling, i ended up near the stairs and tried to crawl 
    to it.But sadly i fell down and accidentaly hit my lower left eye and left a mark beneath it. I got my Lolo's and 
    Lola's really worried about me and hurried me to the nearest hospital.
