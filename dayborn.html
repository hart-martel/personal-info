    A few years later, my mom has given birth tio a cute little baby, and that was me (i was cute when i am still a baby
    back then). She has given birth in her hometown in Ramon Magsaysay, Zamboanga Del Sur. He named the baby 
    as "Rhohart", for me personally, i still doesn't know why she gaved me that name, specially knowing that the name that was
    given is inspired from her long time crush back in her highschool days, i don't even get it like how did my dad agreed 
    to it.. maybe there's still some unknown stories behind it..

    The day that i was also born is also a little bit tragic, because back in that day, When my Lolo's and Lola's heard 
    the news about me, that my mom has already given birth to me, they have planned to get many food and gifts as a 
    celebration for my birthday... but while they are on the way to the hospital, they have been ambushed by the bandits
    and took all of the food and gifts that was for me, they ended up getting hurt with blood all over their face. 
    They were hurried to the hospital and luckily no one is badly hurt that much.
