    My highchool days are not that much, that time i can't really get along well together with  my classmates. 
    Maybe because they would flatter and feel embarassed  if they will hangout with me . Personally, I hate my Juniour 
    Highschool days. After suffering 4 years of loneliness, i agraduated in JHS and finally it's time for my Senior 
    Highschool days. I picked the school that has less more people i know so i can start my new life better as a SHS 
    student. The day has passed and finnaly it's the first day of school and i made sure that day, that i would make a 
    lot of friends and build more confidence for myself. It was a great start and is really going smooth, i achieved  
    those goals that i have set. But later, after a few months, before we move to grade 12, the pandemic happened. it
    seems like the world is not allowing me and forbidding me to do it. i came back into being a lonely person again, 
    just like when i was still in my Juniour highschool days.
